    Above is an AlphaFold interpretation of the protein Tmem81 structure,
    used as a banner for the
    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03886-9"  target="_blank" >Nature editorial from Nov 26, 2025</a>,
    celebrating the fifth anniversary of AlphaFold.
    The main protagonist of the story is prof. Andrea Pauli, whose several-year project was finally

            In their work,  Pauli's lab established that Tmem81 forms trimers with Izumo1 and Spaca6.

            at the time of structure determination, there were no experimental or
            AlphaFold structures available. Below is the superposition of  7TA2 structure (cyan), with some ions (red), and the
            AF 2 structure prediction (cyan), as of Aug 2025.
