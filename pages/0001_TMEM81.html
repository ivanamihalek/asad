    The main protagonist of the story is prof. Andrea Pauli, whose several-year project was finally

            at the time of structure determination, there were no experimental or
            AlphaFold structures available. Shown in the figure below is the superposition of 7TA2 structure (cyan), with some ions (red), and the
            AF2 structure prediction (magenta, the structure with the corkscrew thing), as of Aug 2025.
