    the crystallographers are using af prediction asa template for their solution
 <br>
   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283624003218?via%3Dihub#b0200
    <br>
    pdb cleaim there are not other similar structures, even though the struct predicted by af is beta 0 propeller

    the af itslef
https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/search/text/Q8R555
    <br>
    only has the link back to the structure that the  crystallographers published <br>
    https://www.rcsb.org/structure/9ETN
        <br>
    if the structure is beta propeller, how come there are no more structural or sequence homologs in PDB

    <br> <br>
    something that looks like this origina structure <br>
